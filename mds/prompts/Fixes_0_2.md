# Fixes for version 0.2
 - In the chat interface, show the messages writed by the user on the right, while showing messages from other users on the left.
 - The user profile settings should include a input for uploading a custom avatar. Limit the file size and type to 5mb max.
 - Put the leave chat room button in the chatroom list instead of the chat interface.
 - The unread messages on the chat list are a little bit off, as it also counts the messages sent by the current user. Only count the unread messages from other users.
 - In the chat interface, show the messages date when the last message and the new message changes day date.
 - Improve the read state of the messages, if the other user is in the chat when the messages are sent, they should be marked as read immediately and not count as unread when going back to the chat list.
 - Improve the chatroom list, the last message and count of unread messages should be updated in real-time.
